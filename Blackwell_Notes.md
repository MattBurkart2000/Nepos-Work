# Notes

- Fix footnotes.
- In "The _Life of Hannibal_" section, start by making it clear that you are telling us what Nepos says about Hannibal.
- After the snakes thing, mention that this was an early example of (at the same time) psychological, biological, and chemical warfare. Explain how that works.
- Watch out for over-using "numberous". You can often skip it, or just use "many".
- Add Cannae
- We will meet once more to look at intro and conclusion.
