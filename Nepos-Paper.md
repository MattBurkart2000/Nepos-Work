# Hannibal

## Introduction

This is an introduction to to Nepos's _Lives of Eminent Commanders_. Nepos wrote 25 separate biographies of famous statesmen and military leaders. These biographies are the only completed and surviving works of Nepos, and he dedicated these works to Atticus, his friend. _Lives of Eminent Commanders_ was written in Latin. It gives insight into generals, battles, and wars in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. He begins his work with a dedication and a preface discussing the "excellencies of the Greeks", then jumps into the 25 bigraphical essays [^Pearse].

## Nepos

Nepos was a Roman author who compiled several works during his time. He was born in northern Italy in 110 BCE to a wealthy family and died in 24 BCE.  During his life, he dedicated himself to many different forms of literature. Some of which include poetry, history, geography, and rhetoric [^Mulligan].  His name is featured in several texts, which supports the theory that Nepos authored many works during his time [^Titchener].  However, today his only surviving work is _Lives of Eminent Commanders_. According to surviving works by various historians, Nepos was extremely well-respected and revered during his life and even after. His writing style is said to have been "straightforward, clear, and uncomplicated," [^Mulligan].  "Nepos's works are the earliest surviving biographies written in Latin," [^Stem].

## The _Life of Hannibal_

Great commanders from ancient times gained honor and fame from victory and strategy on the battlefield, yet one man’s tactics stand out from the rest of the field.  Nepos describes how the General Hannibal implemented battle tactics that led to few losses of life and few lost battles, specifically at the battle of Cannae and in the war with Pergamus.  

Hannibal was born into a Carthaginian military family and acquired vast knowledge in the art of war from his father.  He began his first military campaign when he was eighteen under his father.  When his father, the commanding general, died in battle, Hannibal had to step in and lead the army to victory.

At the battle of Cannae, Hannibal annihilated an army almost twice the size of his own.  By drawing in the Roman legions into the center of his army and flanking them with cavalry, Hannibal's army completely surrounded the almost 80,000 Roman soldiers and slaughtered around 70,000 of them.  Scipio, the Roman general who would use this exact same tactic to destroy Hannibal's army at Zama, managed to escape the carnage. Nepos fails to fully detail the battle of Cannae, but does mention it in his work as a sentence [^O'Connell].

Hannibal’s strategy was forever marked in history during Cannae and the naval battle involving the Bithynians and Pergamenians.  Rome attempted to capture and assassinate Hannibal numerous times so Hannibal fled from Carthage and Africa.  He gained sanctuary from Prusias, leader of Bithynia.  Prusias then offered Hannibal command of the entire Bithynian Military.  Bithynia was then in a longstanding war with the Pergamenians, and Hannibal would serve as a valuable asset to the cause.  Hannibal was called into battle with the Bithynian Navy.  Seeing that they were vastly outnumbered, Hannibal devised a bold strategy.  

He ordered slaves to go out and gather as many poisonous snakes as possible, then put the serpents into jars.  Once the navy was prepared, they sailed out and met with the Pergamenians. Hannibal then ordered an emissary to deliver a message to the Pergamonians, so that the Bithynians found the location of the Pergamenian King.  Upon receiving the letter, the Pergamenians believed it was a peace plea and delivered it to their king.  Eumenes opened the letter only to find a blank note.  Enraged, the Pergamenian King ordered a complete assault on the Bithynian Navy.  

Now aware of his location, Hannibal ordered his ships to attack the king.  The Pergamenians, confident in victory, began mocking and laughing at the Bithynians.  The Bithynians laughed as they threw jars at Eumenes’s ships.  Upon seeing the thrown jars, the Pergamenians laughed even harder, until the packages hit their ships.  Seeing the poisonous serpents onboard, the Pergamenians completely abandoned posts and positions.  Chaos ensued.  Hannibal’s navy quickly and swiftly sank numerous ships and killed many of Eumene’s men.  

The Pergamenian King ordered a full retreat, but he still suffered heavy losses.  After this major battle, Hannibal secured victory for the Bithynians with few losses [^Pearse]. Due to his strategic use of toxins from a foreign object, his strategy destroying enemy morale, and his use of a poisonous venom in battle, Hannibal's snake tactic would go down as one of the first uses of biological, psychological, and chemical warfare.

## Conclusion

Nepos authored a detailed biography, which tells of the great stories of Hannibal. Hannibal’s unusual, yet effective tactics won him many battles and wars.  His name was well known throughout the ancient world, and he was feared by opposing forces and enemies. His strategies on the battlefield won over ancient and modern historians, and his tactics have survived well past his lifetime.  General Hannibal will go down as one of the most decorated, most wisest, and most strategic generals of all-time.
